    end
```

### Component Description

1.  **`main.py`**: The application's entry point. It loads the environment, uses `logging_setup.py` to configure the global logger, reads the declarative configs from `config.py`, and initializes and runs the `TradingBot`.

2.  **`config/config.py`**: A purely declarative file containing all static configurations for the bot (MT5, Trading, Telegram, Risk). It contains **no functions** and is the single source of truth for all parameters.

3.  **`utils/logging_setup.py`**: A dedicated utility that handles all logging configuration. It sets up `Loguru`, intercepts the standard Python logger, and configures console and file outputs based on settings in `config.py`.

4.  **TradingBot (`trading_bot.py`)**: The central orchestrator that manages the entire trading process, initializes components, and handles the main event loops.

5.  **MT5Handler (`mt5_handler.py`)**: Manages the connection to MetaTrader 5, handles market data retrieval, and executes trading orders. It includes robust error handling to automatically adjust for broker-specific requirements (e.g., "invalid stops") and can execute **partial position closes**.

6.  **RiskManager (`risk_manager.py`)**: Handles position sizing, risk calculations, and implements trading limits. It performs a crucial final check, re-validating the risk-to-reward ratio *after* any automatic stop adjustments are made by the `MT5Handler` to ensure trade viability.

7.  **SignalProcessor (`src/utils/signal_processor.py`)**: Processes raw signals from strategies, applies risk management rules, and, upon successful execution, **registers the new trade with the `PositionManager`** for lifecycle management.

5.  **PositionManager (`src/utils/position_manager.py`)**: Monitors and manages all open positions. Its responsibilities include:
    - Managing standard trailing stops.
    - Tracking trades with multiple take-profit (TP) levels.
    - Continuously monitoring market price against each TP level.
    - Triggering partial closes via `MT5Handler` when a TP is hit.
    - Updating the trade's state (e.g., remaining volume, next TP).
    - Deregistering trades once they are fully closed.

9.  **DataManager (`src/utils/data_manager.py`)**: Handles market data caching and preprocessing for efficient strategy execution.

10. **MarketUtils (`src/utils/market_utils.py`)**: Provides helper functions for market-specific data, such as symbol information and contract sizes.

11. **TelegramBot (`src/telegram/telegram_bot.py`)**: Provides remote monitoring and control capabilities through Telegram messaging.

12. **PerformanceTracker (`src/utils/performance_tracker.py`)**: Tracks and reports trading performance metrics.

## Trading Strategies

The system is designed to be modular, with strategies implementing a common template (`strategy_template.py`). The current primary strategy is:

1.  **SuperTrendStrategy (`Supertrend.py`)**: A strategy centered around the Supertrend indicator, using a collection of other indicators for confirmation. It generates signals with multiple take-profit levels for sophisticated trade management.

## Risk Management

The risk management system implements several layers of protection:

- **Position Sizing**: Calculates appropriate lot sizes based on account balance and risk percentage
- **Drawdown Protection**: Reduces position sizes or stops trading during drawdown periods
- **Trade Validation**: Validates all trades against risk parameters before execution. This includes a final risk-to-reward ratio check *after* the broker's minimum stop requirements have been met and applied.
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Adjusts position sizes based on market volatility
- **Recovery Mode**: Implements conservative trading during recovery from drawdowns
- **Daily/Weekly Limits**: Enforces limits on number of trades and maximum risk per day/week

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- MetaTrader 5 terminal installed

## 💬 Telegram Integration

The bot uses Telegram for remote monitoring and control. To set it up, you need a bot token and your personal user ID.

### Step 1: Create a Bot with BotFather

1.  **Find BotFather**: Open your Telegram app and search for the official `@BotFather` bot (it has a blue checkmark).
2.  **Start a New Bot**: Send the `/newbot` command to BotFather.
3.  **Name Your Bot**: Follow the prompts to give your bot a user-friendly name (e.g., "My Trading Assistant").
4.  **Set a Username**: Choose a unique username for your bot, which must end in "bot" (e.g., `MyTradingAssistantBot`).
5.  **Save Your Token**: BotFather will provide you with an **API Token**. This is a secret key required for the bot to function. Copy it immediately and keep it safe. You will need it for the `.env` file.

### Step 2: Find Your Telegram User ID

To ensure only you can control the bot, you must provide your unique Telegram User ID.

1.  **Find UserInfo Bot**: In Telegram, search for a bot like `@userinfobot`.
2.  **Get Your ID**: Start a chat with the bot and it will immediately reply with your User ID (it's a long number).
3.  **Save Your ID**: Copy this ID. You will need it for the `.env` file.

### Step 3: Configure the Bot

1.  Add the **API Token** and **User ID** you just obtained to your `.env` file:
    ```
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YourAPITokenFromBotFather
    TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=YourUserIDFromUserInfoBot
    ```
2.  Start the trading bot. You can now communicate with it from your Telegram account.
